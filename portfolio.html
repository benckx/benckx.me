    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of side projects, tutorial, demo and prototypes at various stages of development and completion.
        Most of them are not directly related to my day-to-day work, but peaked my interest at some point.</p>

    <h3>Classify Movies Posters</h3>
    <p>When looking at a movie poster you never saw before, in a train station for example, you can generally get a
        sense of the kind of movie ist is (big colorful fonts signal comedy, faded colors a more serious tone, etc.)
        This made me realize it should be possible to train a small CNN model to detect this.</p>

    <h3>Generate Movies Posters</h3>
    <p>It then occurred to me I could feed the same data into a GAN to generate movie posters, and sample the process at
        each iteration to show the learning process of the model in a video. Granted, it doesn't look like much today,
        given the wide diffusion of stunning AI-generated images, but back in 2018 it was a bit more of a technical
        feat.</p>

    <h3>Generate Abstract Video</h3>
    <p>I then forked this repository in order to improve it for video generation (resolution, frame rate, etc.) and
        customize more hyperparameters (activation functions, convolution windows size, etc.) and
        fed more image sets.</p>

    <h2>Game Development</h2>
    <h3><i>Everybody Loves Bricks</i></h3>
    <p>I have always enjoyed management games. As a teenager Theme Park and Theme Hospital and more recently RimWorld,
        Oxygen Not Included, Dyson Sphere Program.</p>
    <p>So it was expected that I would start coding a game of my own.</p>

    <p>The game is written is Kotlin and is based on the <a href="https://jmonkeyengine.org/" target="_blank">jMonkeyEngine
        (JME)</a>, which is itself based on <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/" target="_blank">Lightweight Java Game

    <h3>Are rappers Gemini?</h3>
    <!-- TODO: move this text to repo, and keep only a summary here -->
    <p>I was arguing with somebody about the legitimacy of astrology. After some back-and-forth, the person stated that
        since "most rappers were Gemini", that would indicate some level of correlation between astrological sign and
        areas of interest.</p>
    <!-- TODO: keep this -->
    <p>I wanted to verify that claim.</p>
    <p>Since it was a falsifiable statement, this kindled my curiosity, and I took a couple of hours to write a small
        script that would fetch all rappers on Wikipedia along their date of birth. Quite unsurprisingly, one would find
        no remarkable or significant correlation between the musical genre and Gemini.</p>
    <p>This may all seems a little bit odd and out of place, but I would argue it is important to develop the tools of
        critical thinking and debunk quackery everywhere it's found.</p>
