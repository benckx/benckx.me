    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of side projects, tutorial, demo and prototypes at various stages of development and completion.
        Most of them are not directly related to my day-to-day work, but peaked my interest at some point.</p>

    <h3>Classify Movies Posters</h3>
    <p>When looking at a movie poster you never saw before, in a train station for example, you can generally get a
        sense of the kind of movie ist is (big colorful fonts signal comedy, faded colors a more serious tone, etc.)
        This made me realize it should be possible to train a small CNN model to detect this.</p>

    <h3>Generate Movies Posters</h3>
    <p>It then occurred to me I could feed the same data into a GAN to generate movie posters, and sample the process at
        each iteration to show the learning process of the model in a video. Granted, it doesn't look like much today,
        given the wide diffusion of stunning AI-generated images, but back in 2018 it was a bit more of a feat to make
        this work.</p>

    <h3>Are rappers Gemini?</h3>
    <p>I was arguing with somebody about the legitimacy of astrology. After some back-and-forth, the person stated that
        since "most rappers were Gemini", that would indicate some level of correlation between astrological sign and
        areas of interest.</p>
    <p>Since it was a falsifiable statement, this kindled my curiosity, and I took a couple of hours to write a small
        script that would fetch all rappers on Wikipedia along their date of birth. Quite unsurprisingly, one would find
        no remarkable or significant correlation between the musical genre and Gemini.</p>
    <p>This may all seems a little bit odd and out of place, but I would argue it is important to develop the tools of
        critical thinking and debunk quackery everywhere it's found.</p>
